# Github Timeline

Github timeline application. Check the live version [here](https://commits-timeline.netlify.app/).

It is a simple app made for learning purposes. My main goal here was to learn the basics of react-redux and expand my knowledge about Styled-Components (stuff like Theme and createGlobalStyles).
Enter github login, and the application will download repositories of that user. Then choose an repository and click it, to see commits history presented on a timeline.

## Technologies

In this project I used:

-   [React](https://pl.reactjs.org/), React Hooks
-   [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) 
-   [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) react-redux, redux-thunk and redux-devtools-extension
-   Jest + Enzyme for some basic testing

## What did I learn?

-   what redux is and what it's used for
-   when you should use it, and when it is better to stick to React Context API
-   more advanced stuff from styledComponents like Theme'ing and using createGlobalStyle
-   basic testing, what tests are, why you should test and what you should test
